sometimes when you import an asset from the Unity Asset Store, the materials will be all messed up. 
if this is the case, the materials will appear pink
in order to fix this, do the following
1. view the messed up material in the Inspector
2. right click up at its name at the very top and  "Copy Material Properties"
3. right click in the project assets and "Create" a new "Material" and view it in the Inspector
4. right click on the name of the new material in the Inspector and click "Paste Material Properties"
5. if the new material is not exactly how it should be, try moving the textures that match the ones being used in the origional broken material
    in the "Albedo" slot in the "Basemap" slot of the new material. Be sure to use the texture directly from the actual file in the folder
